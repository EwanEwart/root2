				  signature: ret_type filename(args)

   .> <filename>		- Redirect command to a given file
      '>' or '1>'		- Redirects the stdout stream only
      '2>'			- Redirects the stderr stream only

				  adds the path to the include paths.

   .O <level>			- Sets the optimization level (0-3)
				  If no level is given, prints the current setting.

   .class <name>		- Prints out class <name> in a CINT-like style (one-level).
				  If no name is given, prints out list of all classes.

   .Class <name>		- Prints out class <name> in a CINT-like style (all-levels).
				  If no name is given, prints out list of all classes.

   .namespace			- Prints list of all known namespaces

   .typedef <name>		- Prints out typedef <name> in a CINT-like style
				  If no name is given, prints out list of all typedefs.

   .@ 				- Cancels and ignores the multiline input

   .rawInput [0|1]		- Toggle wrapping and printing the
				  execution results of the input

   .dynamicExtensions [0|1]	- Toggles the use of the dynamic scopes
				  and the late binding

   .debug <level>		- Generates debug symbols (level is optional, 0 to disable)

   .printDebug [0|1]		- Toggles the printing of input's corresponding
				  state changes

   .storeState <filename>	- Store the interpreter's state to a given file

   .compareState <filename>	- Compare the interpreter's state with the one
				  saved in a given file

   .stats [name]		- Show stats for internal data structures
				  'ast'  abstract syntax tree stats
				  'asttree [filter]'  abstract syntax tree layout
				  'decl' dump ast declarations
				  'undo' show undo stack

   .T <filePath> <comment>	- Generate autoload map

   .trace <repr> <id>		- Dump trace of requested respresentation
				  (see .stats arguments for <repr>)

   .help			- Shows this information (also .?)

   .(x|X) <filename>[flags](args) :
                         same as .L <filename>[flags] and runs then a function
